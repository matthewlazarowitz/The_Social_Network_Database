## Description


In this challenge, we were tasked with building an API for a social network web application using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM. The API enables users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. To achieve this, we created models for User, Thought, and Reaction, each with specific schema settings and virtuals to handle complex relationships and retrieve data efficiently. The API includes various routes to perform CRUD operations on users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists. The GET routes enable us to retrieve all users and thoughts, as well as a single user and thought. Meanwhile, the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes allow us to create, update, and delete users and thoughts effectively.  As well,  the API includes routes to add and remove friends to a user's friend list and to create and delete reactions to thoughts. Throughout the development process, we demonstrated our proficiency in using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB to design and build a scalable and efficient social network API. By completing this project, we gained valuable experience in working with NoSQL databases, data modeling, and handling complex relationships in web applications.

## Usage

This project was an exciting challenge that tested our skills in building a robust API for a social network web application. While this API may not cover all the advanced features found in large-scale social networking platforms, it serves as an excellent foundation for handling large amounts of unstructured data and handling complex relationships between users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.  While this API may not have all the bells and whistles of a fully-fledged social networking platform, it provides the fundamental building blocks for such an application. As our skills and experience grow, we can envision expanding the API to include more advanced features and customization options for users, allowing them to create a more personalized social networking experience!
